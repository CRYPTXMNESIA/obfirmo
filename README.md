# Obfirmo

## Features

- **Free and Easy to Use**: Simple interface to generate secure passwords.
- **Offline Functionality**: No data collection, works entirely offline.
- **Security Breach Checker**: Uses the Have I Been Pwned API to check if the generated password has been compromised.

- **Browser Compatibility**: Works best on modern browsers.
